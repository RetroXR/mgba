/* A Game Boy link cable carried by the frontend's link bus.
 *
 * The Game Boy Advance's netlink driver does not cover this. mGBA's Game Boy is
 * a separate core with a separate serial port and a separate driver interface,
 * and a GBA link cable and a Game Boy one have nothing in common but the shape
 * of the thing you push in. A cable between two Game Boys run by this core
 * reached nobody at all before this existed.
 *
 * WHAT CROSSES. A Game Boy's serial port is two machines and one wire, and
 * unlike a GBA's it has no notion of a parent: whichever unit selects the
 * internal clock (SC bit 0) drives the transfer, and that is a choice the GUEST
 * makes, both ends being identical hardware. So there are only two messages. A
 * machine says what its serial register holds and whether it is armed
 * (GBNL_STATE), and a machine that clocks a transfer says so (GBNL_CLOCK).
 *
 * The protocol id and the message layout are shared byte for byte with
 * gambatte's driver, so a Game Boy run by this core and one run by gambatte can
 * be joined by the same cable.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT. The four-player adapter and the Game Boy Printer are not
 * carried, and anything past a pair is refused: mGBA's own GBSIO is built for
 * MAX_GBS of two, and a bus that quietly joined three would produce transfers no
 * real cable could.
