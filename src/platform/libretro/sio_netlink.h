/* A GBA link cable carried by the frontend's link bus.
 *
 * This is GBASIOLockstepCoordinator's job done one level up. The coordinator
 * is a shared structure behind a mutex, which works when several GBAs run
 * inside one program, but a libretro frontend running two cores at once
 * generally loads each from its own copy of the shared library. Two instances
 * then share no globals whatsoever and cannot find each other, so the bus has
 * to live in the frontend and the cores have to reach it through
 * RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_LINK_INTERFACE.
 *
 * Multiplayer AND normal mode are carried; UART and JOY are not.
 *
 * Normal mode is what single-cartridge play runs over: the host sends a client
 * with no cartridge at all a program to run out of its RAM, in 32-bit words.
 * At the fast internal clock those words take 256 cycles against multiplayer's
 * 5755; the slow clock takes 2048. The shortest case sets the safe bound, so
 * normal mode cannot share multiplayer's commit horizon and the horizon follows
 * the mode rather than being one constant. */
