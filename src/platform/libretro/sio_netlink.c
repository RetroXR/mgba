/* Floor for the rendezvous grain, and what is used before a party is known.
 *
 * The floor is cost: every grain is a rendezvous between threads, so this cannot
 * go lower without the cores spending their time synchronising rather than
 * emulating. Measured on a four-handheld Quest session, the host coordinator's
 * wake path was 23.67% of all CPU cycles against 6.49% for the four emulators
 * put together, and a bench over that bus puts the cost dead linear in the
 * rendezvous RATE: at four machines, 27.5 ms of bus time at grain 256 against
 * 4.0 ms at 2048, with every other measured number unchanged.
 *
 * This is no longer the multiplayer ceiling as well; see _grainForMulti.
 *
 * The comment replaced here stated a quarter of the shortest transfer as the
 * rule and then used 256, which is a TWENTY-SECOND of a two-unit transfer, on
 * the strength of "at 1024 a good share of transfers completed with only one
 * half present". That measurement does not survive its own history. It was
 * written 2026-08-20 09:23, in the same commit as the first "get both halves of
 * a transfer" fix, and two more landed after it: the monotonic clock at 09:33,
 * and at 09:38 the one that matters -- a child latched its word when the start
 * MESSAGE arrived rather than when the master's clock reached the transfer,
 * which that commit describes as "a whole commit horizon earlier". That bug grew
 * WITH the horizon, so a larger grain made it worse, which is exactly what was
 * seen and blamed on the grain. Nobody re-measured after the fix. */

/* And how often to look when there is nothing to look FOR.
 *
 * The grain above is sized so that the two halves of a transfer meet inside the
 * horizon. That constraint only exists while a transfer can actually happen: a
 * port with nobody on the far end has nothing to be late for, and the fine
 * grain is then pure overhead paid every 256 cycles for ever.
 *
 * Measured, on Four Swords Adventures with four handhelds: each machine's SIO
 * port made 9.8 MILLION calls into the bus over one run and blocked for zero
 * milliseconds in all of them, because no link lead was in it. Across four
 * handhelds that is 39 million round trips through the coordinator's lock,
 * competing with the ports that had real work to do. The audio crackled.
 *
 * One nominal video frame is still much faster than a person can seat a cable,
 * while reducing an uncabled port's membership polling by another factor of
 * about 68 compared with the former 4096-cycle interval. _refreshPeers returns
 * to the active grain as soon as a peer appears. */

/* Multiplayer's grain, which depends on how many machines are on the wire.
 *
 * A multiplayer transfer gets LONGER as the party grows -- 5755 cycles for two
 * units, 10486 for four -- so the constraint loosens with every handheld that
 * joins, while a constant tightens it for nobody's benefit. The party is the
 * only input: the BAUD is deliberately not consulted, and the fastest one is
 * assumed instead. A game may change baud at any time, and a horizon sized to a
 * slow baud would be invalidated by that write; sizing to the fastest means the
 * real transfer is only ever longer than the one planned for.
 *
 * One sixteenth of the shortest. The mechanism only needs the horizon to fit
 * inside the transfer: the master announces at commit = now + horizon, and a
 * peer reaches that horizon before latching its word. The master can only reach
 * the transfer's finish once the child has published far enough for it to,
 * which is commit + cycles - horizon >= commit whenever horizon <= cycles.
 * Half was fast, but it added 50 percent to every back-to-back transfer. The
 * e-Reader protocol has a fixed receive deadline and consistently aborted an
 * otherwise correct 999-word card at word 863; one eighth still reached only
 * word 984. One sixteenth keeps the commit delay inside that deadline while
 * retaining a useful rendezvous grain.
 *
 * Never below NETLINK_GRAIN, so a pair can never end up finer than it is today.
